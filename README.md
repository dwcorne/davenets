# davenets
DAVENETS is a simulator of timetabled transport of demand across network structures, initially developed for bus passenger/parcel system simulation

DAVENETS stands for Discrete And VErsatile NEtwork Transport Simulation.
It was initiated in 2025 as part of the TRANSIT EPRSC project (and inspired by the earlier SOAST project), in order to investigate passenger/parcel systems
operating on bus routes.
